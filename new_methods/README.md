# Deconvolution Training Files

* `geneexp_cspline.sh`, `geneexp_cspline_fit.R`, `methylation_cspline.sh`, `methylation_cspline_fit.R` fits cubic splines to each feature
* `*_train_deconv_type1.R` and `*_train_deconv_type1.sh` fit the simplest version of deconvolution.
* `*_train_deconv_type2.R` and `*_train_deconv_type2.sh` fit deconvolution with sum-to-one constraint and smoothness penalty
* `*_train_deconv_type3.R` and `*_train_deconv_type3.sh` fit deconvolution with smoothness and sparseness penalty
